        <i><b>Pseudo-classes</b></i> are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document
        tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        One example of a <ins>widely used pseudo-class</ins> is <code style="color: green;">:hover</code>, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible
        element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or <kbd style="color: blue;">#elementid:hover</kbd>.
    </p>
    <p>
        A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that
        may consist of partial elements, such as <code style="color: magenta;">::first-line</code> or <code style="color: magenta;">::first-letter</code>.<sup><a href="#" style="color: blue;">[6]</a></sup> Note the distinction between the
        double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for pseudo-classes.
